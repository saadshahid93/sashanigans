    "# Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will be analyzing the Twitter data we extracted using [this](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) api. This time, we extracted the tweets posted by the following six Twitter accounts: `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP, HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every tweet, we collected two pieces of information:\n",
    "- `screen_name`: the Twitter handle of the user tweeting and\n",
    "- `text`: the content of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided the tweets into two parts - the train and test sets.  The training set contains both the `screen_name` and `text` of each tweet; the test set only contains the `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of the problem is to infer the political inclination (whether **R**epublican or **D**emocratic) of the author from the tweet text. The ground truth (i.e., true class labels) are determined from the `screen_name` of the tweet as follows:\n",
    "- **R**: `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP`\n",
    "- **D**: `HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can treat this as a binary classification problem. We'll follow this common structure to tackling this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **preprocessing**: clean up the raw tweet text using the various functions offered by [the Natural Language Toolkit (`nltk`)](http://www.nltk.org/genindex.html).\n",
    "2. **features**: construct bag-of-words feature vectors.\n",
    "3. **classification**: learn a binary classification model using [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `nltk` supports optional corpora, toy grammars, trained models, etc. For this assignment, you have to manually install the stopwords list and `WordNetLemmatizer`. We'll begin by installing them:"
